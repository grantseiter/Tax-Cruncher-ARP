// JSON "reform" file that specifies changes in current-law policy that
// are required to make Tax-Calculator work like TAXSIM-27.
//
// (1) AMT_child_em_c_age = 24 (rather than 18)
//     Whether to set this parameter to 18 or 24 is arbitary because
//     neither model has enough information to apply correctly the child
//     AMT exemption rules.  Information on full-time student status and
//     whether taxpayers provide more than half of their support are required
//     to apply the rules correctly.  Tax-Calculator makes the arbitrary
//     assumption that only those under 18 are required to use the child
//     AMT exemption rules, while TAXSIM-27 makes the arbitrary assumption
//     that all those under 24 are required to use the child AMT exemption.
//     (This change was introduced for assumption set b and higher.)
//
// (2) EITC_excess_InvestIncome_rt = 1.0 (rather than 9e99)
//     The rate at which the EITC amount is reduced per dollar of investment
//     income in excess of the EITC investment income ceiling is infinity under
//     current law (that is, any investment income in excess of the ceiling
//     causes EITC ineligibility).  However, TAXSIM-27 assumes it is one, so
//     that the EITC amount is reduced a dollar for each dollar of excess
//     investment income.  This difference in the parameter value leads to
//     many EITC differences in the randomly-generated validation samples,
//     with some of the differences being in the thousands of dollars.  This
//     non-current-law assumption in TAXSIM-27 is presumably made to reduce
//     the magnitude of model-calculated marginal tax rates with respect to
//     investment income in cases where a marginal increase in investment
//     income takes a filing unit above the ceiling.
