### Note:
The Tax-Cruncher-ARP simulation accepts an individual's information necessary for computing federal tax liabilities and leverages [Tax-Calculator](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator), an open-source microsimulation model of federal individual income and payroll tax law. Users can explore how the [American Rescue Plan Act of 2021](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text) impacts their 2021 federal tax liability and compare the result to previous law (if the plan had not become law). The Tax-Cruncher-ARP simulation is solely for educational use and should not be used for tax preparation purposes.
